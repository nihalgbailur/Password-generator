# Password-generator
A password generator is a program that generates random passwords for users.
The first line of code imports the random module, which allows the program to generate random numbers, letters, and symbols.

The next four lines of code define four string variables that contain different sets of characters. These sets include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

The next line of code combines all of the sets of characters into one string variable called "string".

The following line of code prompts the user to input an integer value that will determine the length of the password that will be generated.
Let me explain the line of code password = "".join(random.sample(string, length)) in detail:

The random.sample(string, length) function generates a random list of characters of length length from the string string. The random.sample() function ensures that each character in the list is unique, so there will be no repetitions in the generated password.

The "".join() function is used to join the characters in the list generated by random.sample() together into a single string. The empty string "" is used as the separator between the characters.

Finally, the resulting string is assigned to the variable password. The password variable now contains a randomly generated password of length length that contains a mix of characters from the sets of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

The next line of code uses the "random.sample()" method to randomly select "length" number of characters from the "string" variable. This method ensures that the password contains a mix of characters from all the sets of characters defined in the previous lines.

The final line of code prints the generated password to the console.
